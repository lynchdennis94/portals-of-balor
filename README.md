* Not including the resources folder _yet_. I plan on using a CP437 file from the dwarf fortress wiki as a placeholder, but for now I'll use whatever is being provided by default
* I'm using the new bracket_lib crate, instead of the rltk wrapper. I don't know that I'll necessarily want the extras included in the full bracket_lib (rltk is a portion of the wider library iiuc), but for the sake of giving me options and not requiring a massive rewrite later, I'll go with the current latest-and-greatest
